## What is "Generate"?

Generate is a command line tool and developer framework for scaffolding out new GitHub projects using [generators](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/generators.md) and [tasks](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md).

Answers to prompts and the user's environment can be used to determine the templates, directories, files and contents to build. Support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins, and much more.

**For more information**:

* Visit the [generate project](https://github.com/generate/generate/)
* Visit the [generate documentation](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/)
* Find [generators on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/generate-generator) (help us [author generators](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/micro-generators.md))

## Getting started

### Install

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `webtask` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [Generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Install generate-webtask**

Install this module with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-webtask
```

### Usage

Run this generator's `default` [task](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#default) with the following command:

```sh
$ gen webtask
```

**What you should see in the terminal**

If completed successfully, you should see both `starting` and `finished` events in the terminal, like the following:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting ...
...
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

If you do not see one or both of those events, please [let us know about it](../../issues).

### Help

To see a general help menu and available commands for Generate's CLI, run:

```sh
$ gen help
```

## Tasks

All available tasks.

### [webtask:simple](generator.js#L23)

Generate an `index.js` file to the current working directory with a [simple webtask function](https://webtask.io/docs/model). Learn how to [customize behavior(#customization) or override built-in templates.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen webtask:simple
```

### [webtask:context](generator.js#L38)

Generate an `index.js` file to the current working directory with a [webtask function with context](https://webtask.io/docs/model). Learn how to [customize behavior(#customization) or override built-in templates.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen webtask:context
```

### [webtask:http](generator.js#L52)

Generate an `index.js` file to the current working directory with a [webtask function with full HTTP control](https://webtask.io/docs/model). Learn how to [customize behavior(#customization) or override built-in templates.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen webtask:http
```

### [webtask](generator.js#L65)

Alias for running the [webtask](#webtask) task with the following command:

**Example**

```sh
$ gen webtask
```

Visit Generate's [documentation for tasks](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md).

## Files trees

The following files trees are automatically generated by a task in [verbfile.js](verbfile.js).

* [generated files](#generated-files): trees representing the actual generated "dest" files for each task
* [source files](#source-files): trees representing the source files and templates used by each task

_(See Generate's [customization docs ](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/customization.md) to learn how to override individual templates.)_

### Generated files

Files generated by each task (e.g. `dest` files). See the Generate [customization docs ](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/customization.md) to learn how to override individual templates.

Note that diffs are base on comparisons against the files generated by the `default` task. Additionally, some tasks generate the same files, but with different contents (for example, the contents of `index.js` differs based on the task).

#### default

Files generated by the [default task](#default):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

#### simple

Files generated by the [simple task](#simple):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

#### context

Files generated by the [context task](#context):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

#### http

Files generated by the [http task](#http):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

### Source files

The following trees represent the source files or templates that are used by each task. You'll see that most of the tasks use at least one "micro-generator" to generate a specific file.

#### default

Source files and/or libraries used by the [default task](#default):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_simple.js
```

#### simple

Source files and/or libraries used by the [simple task](#simple):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_simple.js
```

#### context

Source files and/or libraries used by the [context task](#context):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_context.js
```

#### http

Source files and/or libraries used by the [http task](#http):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_http.js
```

## Next steps

### Running unit tests

It's never too early to begin running unit tests. When you're ready to get started, the following command will ensure the project's dependencies are installed then run all of the unit tests:

```sh
$ npm install && test
```

### Publishing your project

If you're tests are passing and you're ready to publish your project to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), you can do that now with the following command:

**Are you sure you're ready?!**

```sh
$ npm publish
```
