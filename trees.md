The following files trees are automatically generated by a task in [verbfile.js](verbfile.js).

- [generated files](#generated-files): trees representing the actual generated "dest" files for each task
- [source files](#source-files): trees representing the source files and templates used by each task

_(See Generate's [customization docs ][docs]{customization.md} to learn how to override individual templates.)_

### Generated files

Files generated by each task (e.g. `dest` files). See the Generate [customization docs ][docs]{customization.md} to learn how to override individual templates.

Note that diffs are base on comparisons against the files generated by the `default` task. Additionally, some tasks generate the same files, but with different contents (for example, the contents of `index.js` differs based on the task).

#### default

Files generated by the [default task](#default):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

#### simple

Files generated by the [simple task](#simple):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

#### context

Files generated by the [context task](#context):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

#### http

Files generated by the [http task](#http):

```diff
 .
 └── index.js
```

### Source files

The following trees represent the source files or templates that are used by each task. You'll see that most of the tasks use at least one "micro-generator" to generate a specific file.

#### default

Source files and/or libraries used by the [default task](#default):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_simple.js
```

#### simple

Source files and/or libraries used by the [simple task](#simple):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_simple.js
```

#### context

Source files and/or libraries used by the [context task](#context):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_context.js
```

#### http

Source files and/or libraries used by the [http task](#http):

```diff
 .
 └─┬ templates
   └── index_http.js
```
